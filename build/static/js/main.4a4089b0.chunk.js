Getting actual NHL players to surround Bedard should help him out quite a bit after being fed to the wolves last season.

The lone low point was the Yaroslav Askarov trade saga that went down at the end of summer. Nashville was already a bit of a surprise success last year. They looked dead in the water after a 9-2 loss at the hand of Dallas in mid February. They went 20-5-3 from that point on. Filip Forsberg set a career high in points with new linemates Ryan O\u2019Reilly and Gustav Nyquist. Roman Josi was once again a Norris candidate. Despite a uncharacteristically poor start from Saros, he righted the ship at the end of the season. Nashville is a very interesting team in the fact they are not exactly a young team and are carried by solid veterans. Evangelista is the only NHL mainstay of their \u201cyoung\u201d players.

I am skeptical on Winnipeg\u2019s center depth behind Scheifele and Lowry. Outside of that, they have pretty solid depth on the wings. Alex Iaffalo is still incredibly effective defensively, but has taken on a lesser role in Winnipeg that seems to have limited his offensive ceiling.

Logan Stanley can\u2019t stay healthy and isn\u2019t very good when he is in the lineup. Maybe they have something in Samberg? The Jets ace in their back pocket is obviously Mr. Hellebuyck.

I am not huge on either of these signings, especially in the long term. I think E. Lindholm is good and probably an upgrade on Coyle or Zacha, but there are still holes in his 5 on 5 play. I do believe he and Pastrnak could be a great duo. Zadorov is an effective player but I always worry about how skaters who play the physical style like Zadorov do age.

In what continues to be one of the most bizarre careers, Jeff Skinner had a below average Jeff Skinner season and subsequently led to his buyout. Buffalo was a lot better at keeping pucks out of the net last year. UPL took a huge step last year and looks to be a legitimate answer for a starting goalie. If Levi takes a step, this could be a solid goaltending tandem. Rasmus Dahlin has established himself as a truly elite number 1 on defense. Owen Power took a huge stride in his defensive game last season as well. Bowen Byrams career has obviously been disappointing so far (at least he played 73 games last year) hopefully Buffalo can unlock something there. I think there are exciting pieces here. JJ Peterka has been developing into a nice scoring option. Jack Quinn has looked great when he has been available. Zach Benson had a nice enough rookie year.

There are some nightmare contracts on this team, especially on defense. Justin Holl is being paid $3.4 million for the next two years to be a healthy scratch and Ben Chiarot is just plain bad. Andrew Copp was another bad deal from the day it was signed. I like the addition of Erik Gustafsson and it looks like Simon Edvinsson is ready to take on a full NHL season. Seider has not been able to replicate his fantastic rookie season, but he has been stapled to Chiarot and faces the leagues toughest competition. The forward group is pretty similar to last year. Tarasenko is a scoring upgrade on Perron from last year. Having Kane for a full season will help the offense as well. The Wings got made fun of for signing a ton of goalies, but I actually like it. Talbot, while on the wrong side of 30, has been pretty consistent since 2020. Lyon was huge for them when Husso went down/was bad last season after doing the same thing for the Panthers in 2023. There are much worse 4th goalies you can have than Jack Campbell, who I will always be cheering for. Being close to home whether he is in the NHL or AHL might be awesome for him. I am skeptical of this team and I think they overperformed last season. I don\u2019t like the way Steve Yzerman has handled free agency the past few years.

Joonas Johansson is a bad NHL goalie. He saved the early part of Tampa\u2019s season, but outside of that hot streak there is very little to show that he can play at the NHL level. Obviously the big news out of Tampa this offseason was letting their best player in franchise history walk in free agency. It\u2019s going to be absolutely bizarre not seeing him on this Lightning squad. Stamkos has been my favorite player for more than a decade and I hope he kills it in Nashville. Tampa signed Jake Guentzel to fill the Stamkos hole. A more than suitable replacement, in fact it is an upgrade at this stage of their careers.
